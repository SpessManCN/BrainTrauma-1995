      if lighting changes are required
  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.
  NotDhu:
  - bugfix: Blueshift's white ship docking port should now work correctly.

      price of 14 TC.

      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!

      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss

      their baseline equipment NOW.
